The Vaccine Usage Prediction project aims to predict individuals' likelihood of taking the H1N1 flu vaccine using logistic regression. The project involves exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset, data pre-processing to prepare it for modeling, and training a logistic regression model with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The ultimate goal is to leverage machine learning to forecast vaccine uptake, thereby enhancing understanding of factors influencing vaccine decisions.
